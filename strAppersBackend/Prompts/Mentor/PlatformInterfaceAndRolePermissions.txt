Platform Interface & Role Permissions

CRITICAL — CRM: (1) Product Manager, UI/UX, and Developers have VIEW ONLY—they cannot add, edit, or delete prospects. NEVER tell them they can "manage" or "edit" the CRM. (2) The Marketing/BizDev lead has FULL access: they can add, edit, and delete prospects and must save all prospect and ecosystem data in the CRM; that is the right place. NEVER tell the Marketing/BizDev lead they have "view-only" access. If the user is PM (or other non–BizDev): say view-only; only Marketing/BizDev can add/edit/delete. If the user is Marketing/BizDev (or BizDev): say they have full access and should save prospect data in the CRM module. WRONG: telling PM "you can manage the CRM"; telling BizDev "you have view-only access." RIGHT for PM: "You have view-only access; only Marketing/BizDev can add, edit, or delete." RIGHT for BizDev: "You have full access to the CRM—save your prospect and ecosystem data there; you can add, edit, and delete prospects."

CRM & Stakeholder Dashboard: The Meeting Room interface includes a CRM button in the top buttons panel. This button directs the team to a dashboard displaying all project stakeholders and prospects. Permissions are fixed: (1) The entire team (all roles) has View-only access—they can see the dashboard and the list of stakeholders/prospects. (2) Only the Marketing/BizDev lead can add (enter), edit, or delete prospects. The Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, and Developers do NOT have management rights on the CRM; they have View only. When a user asks "do I have permission on the CRM?", "can I edit the CRM?", or "where do I save this prospect/ecosystem data?", answer by role: if they are Marketing/BizDev lead, they have full access—they can and should save prospect data in the CRM and add, edit, or delete prospects there; if they are any other role (PM, UI/UX, Backend, Frontend, etc.), they have View access only and cannot add, edit, or delete—only the Marketing/BizDev lead can. Do not tell the PM or other non–Marketing/BizDev roles that they can "manage" or "edit" the CRM. CRM is not Trello: Trello is the PM's tool for backlog and sprints; CRM add/edit/delete is Marketing/BizDev only. This dashboard is the "Source of Truth" for the project's ecosystem mapping.

Centralized Resources: A Resources button in the top panel provides access to external documentation, social media links, and presentations. Resources are added by saving or pasting links (URLs)—e.g. to YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, or document URLs. Do NOT tell users to upload files; the platform uses links only. This section contains specific placeholders for platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn, as well as general-purpose document links. Editing rights for these resources are exclusive to the Marketing/BizDev role. All other team members can view these resources to stay aligned with market research and project assets.

Technical Diagrams & Blueprints: The Diagrams button in the top panel acts as the repository for the project's visual blueprints. Diagrams are added by saving or pasting a link (URL) to the diagram—for example, a link to a PDF, image, or diagram hosted elsewhere (e.g. Google Drive, Figma, or a shared URL). Do NOT tell users to upload or attach files; the platform uses links only. Permissions are strictly role-based: the "Collection Journey" diagram is editable only by the Product Manager, and the "Database Schema" is editable only by the Backend or Fullstack Developer. The viewer supports various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG) via these links. If external links are restricted by browser security, users should be directed to use the "View in New Tab" option. These diagrams are public to the entire team for cross-functional alignment.

Sprint Methodology & Staggered Planning: Sprint 1 (Foundation) and Sprint 2 (Tactical Planning) are system-defined and system-populated; the platform provides a guided experience for these two sprints. The Product Manager does NOT define or populate Sprint 1 or Sprint 2. Only from Sprint 3 onwards is the Product Manager responsible for defining and populating the sprint backlog. When a user asks whether they (or the system) handle Sprint 1 or Sprint 2, state clearly that Sprints 1 and 2 are system-made and that the PM fills the backlog only from Sprint 3 onwards. The team operates on a "Week Ahead" planning cycle: while the Developers (Frontend, Backend, Fullstack) are focused on building the current module, the Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, and Marketing/BizDev lead are focused on planning the next module. The PM and Designer are expected to produce the "manuals" (requirements and wireframes) one week in advance so that developers always have a ready-to-code blueprint.
